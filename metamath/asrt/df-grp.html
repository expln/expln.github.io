A group is a monoid ( ~ df-mnd ) whose\\n       internal operation is such that every element admits a left inverse\\n       (which can be proven to be a two-sided inverse).  Thus, a group ` G ` is\\n       an algebraic structure formed from a base set of elements (notated\\n       ` ( Base `` G ) ` per ~ df-base ) and an internal group operation\\n       (notated ` ( +g `` G ) ` per ~ df-plusg ).  The operation combines any\\n       two elements of the group base set and must satisfy the 4 group axioms:\\n       closure (the result of the group operation must always be a member of\\n       the base set, see ~ grpcl ), associativity (so\\n       ` ( ( a +g b ) +g c ) = ( a +g ( b +g c ) ) ` for any a, b, c, see\\n       ~ grpass ), identity (there must be an element ` e = ( 0g `` G ) ` such\\n       that ` e +g a = a +g e = a ` for any a), and inverse (for each element a\\n       in the base set, there must be an element ` b = invg a ` in the base set\\n       such that ` a +g b = b +g a = e ` ).  It can be proven that the identity\\n       element is unique ( ~ grpideu ).  Groups need not be commutative; a\\n       commutative group is an Abelian group (see ~ df-abl ).  Subgroups can\\n       often be formed from groups, see ~ df-subg .  An example of an (Abelian)\\n       group is the set of complex numbers ` CC ` over the group operation\\n       ` + ` (addition), as proven in ~ cnaddablx ; an Abelian group is a group\\n       as proven in ~ ablgrp .  Other structures include groups, including\\n       unital rings ( ~ df-ring ) and fields ( ~ df-field ).  (Contributed by\\n       NM, 17-Oct-2012.)
