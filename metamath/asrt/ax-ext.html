It\\n       states that two sets are identical if they contain the same elements.\\n       Axiom Ext of [BellMachover] p. 461.\\n\\n       Set theory can also be formulated with a _single_ primitive predicate\\n       ` e. ` on top of traditional predicate calculus _without_ equality.  In\\n       that case the Axiom of Extensionality becomes\\n       ` ( A. w ( w e. x <-> w e. y ) -> ( x e. z -> y e. z ) ) ` , and\\n       equality ` x = y ` is _defined_ as ` A. w ( w e. x <-> w e. y ) ` .  All\\n       of the usual axioms of equality then become theorems of set theory.\\n       See, for example, Axiom 1 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 8.\\n\\n       To use the above \\\"equality-free\\\" version of Extensionality with\\n       Metamath's predicate calculus axioms, we would rewrite all axioms\\n       involving equality with equality expanded according to the above\\n       definition.  Some of those axioms may be provable from ax-ext and would\\n       become redundant, but this hasn't been studied carefully.\\n\\n       _General remarks_:  Our set theory axioms are presented using defined\\n       connectives ( ` <-> ` , ` E. ` , etc.) for convenience.  However, it is\\n       implicitly understood that the actual axioms use only the primitive\\n       connectives ` -> ` , ` -. ` , ` A. ` , ` = ` , and ` e. ` .  It is\\n       straightforward to establish the equivalence between the actual axioms\\n       and the ones we display, and we will not do so.\\n\\n       It is important to understand that strictly speaking, all of our set\\n       theory axioms are really schemes that represent an infinite number of\\n       actual axioms.  This is inherent in the design of Metamath\\n       (\\\"metavariable math\\\"), which manipulates only metavariables.  For\\n       example, the metavariable ` x ` in ~ ax-ext can represent any actual\\n       variable _v1_, _v2_, _v3_,... .  Distinct variable restrictions ($d)\\n       prevent us from substituting say _v1_ for both ` x ` and ` z ` .  This\\n       is in contrast to typical textbook presentations that present actual\\n       axioms (except for Replacement ~ ax-rep , which involves a wff\\n       metavariable).  In practice, though, the theorems and proofs are\\n       essentially the same.  The $d restrictions make each of the infinite\\n       axioms generated by the ~ ax-ext scheme exactly logically equivalent to\\n       each other and in particular to the actual axiom of the textbook\\n       version.
