A poset is a set\\n       equipped with a partial order, that is, a binary relation which is\\n       reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.  Unlike a total order, in a\\n       partial order there may be pairs of elements where neither precedes the\\n       other.  Definition of poset in [Crawley] p. 1.

The quantifiers ` E. b E. r ` provide a\\n       notational shorthand to allow us to refer to the base and ordering\\n       relation as ` b ` and ` r ` in the definition rather than having to\\n       repeat ` ( Base `` f ) ` and ` ( le `` f ) ` throughout.
