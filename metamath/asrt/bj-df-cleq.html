The similarity of the hypothesis and the conclusion makes\\n       it clear that this definition merely extends to class variables\\n       something that is true for setvar variables, hence is conservative.\\n       This definition should be directly referenced only by ~ bj-dfcleq ,\\n       which should be used instead.  The proof is irrelevant since this is a\\n       proposal for an axiom.\\n\\n       Another definition, which would give finer control, is actually the pair\\n       of definitions where each has one implication of the present\\n       biconditional as hypothesis and conclusion.  They assert that\\n       extensionality (respectively, the left-substitution axiom for the\\n       membership predicate) extends from setvars to classes.
