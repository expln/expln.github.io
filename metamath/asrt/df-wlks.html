TODO-AV:  This\\n       corresponds to the definition of ` Walks ` , but can be removed and the\\n       defining theorem ~ upgriswlk could be used instead.\\n\\n       According to Wikipedia (\\\"Path (graph theory)\\\",\\n       ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) , 3-Oct-2017):  \\\"A\\n       walk of length k in a graph is an alternating sequence of vertices and\\n       edges, v0 , e0 , v1 , e1 , v2 , ... , v(k-1) , e(k-1) , v(k) which\\n       begins and ends with vertices.  If the graph is undirected, then the\\n       endpoints of e(i) are v(i) and v(i+1).\\\"\\n\\n       According to Bollobas:  \\\" A walk W in a graph is an alternating sequence\\n       of vertices and edges x0 , e1 , x1 , e2 , ... , e(l) , x(l) where e(i) =\\n       x(i-1)x(i), 0<i<=l.\\\", see Definition of [Bollobas] p. 4.\\n\\n       Therefore, a walk can be represented by two mappings f from { 1 , ... ,\\n       n } and p from { 0 , ... , n }, where f enumerates the (indices of the)\\n       edges, and p enumerates the vertices.  So the walk is represented by the\\n       following sequence: p(0) e(f(1)) p(1) e(f(2)) ... p(n-1) e(f(n)) p(n).\\n\\n       Although this definition is also applicable for arbitrary hypergraphs,\\n       it allows only walks consisting of not proper hyperedges (i.e. edges\\n       connecting at most two vertices).  Therefore, it should be used for\\n       pseudograhs only.  (Contributed by Alexander van der Vekens and Mario\\n       Carneiro, 4-Oct-2017.)
