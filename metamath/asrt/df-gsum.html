It may be viewed as a product (if ` G ` is a\\n       multiplication), a sum (if ` G ` is an addition) or whatever.  The\\n       variable ` k ` is normally a free variable in ` B ` ( i.e. ` B ` can be\\n       thought of as ` B ( k ) ` ).  The definition is meaningful in different\\n       contexts, depending on the size of the index set ` A ` and each\\n       demanding different properties of ` G ` .\\n\\n       1.  If ` A = (/) ` and ` G ` has an identity element, then the sum\\n       equals this identity.\\n\\n       2.  If ` A = ( M ... N ) ` and ` G ` is any magma, then the sum is the\\n       sum of the elements, evaluated left-to-right, i.e.\\n       ` ( B ( 1 ) + B ( 2 ) ) + B ( 3 ) ` etc.\\n\\n       3.  If ` A ` is a finite set (or is nonzero for finitely many indices)\\n       and ` G ` is a commutative monoid, then the sum adds up these elements\\n       in some order, which is then uniquely defined.\\n\\n       4.  If ` A ` is an infinite set and ` G ` is a Hausdorff topological\\n       group, then there is a meaningful sum, but ` gsum ` cannot handle this\\n       case.  See ~ df-tsms .  Remark: this definition is required here because\\n       the symbol ` gsum ` is already used in ~ df-prds and ~ df-imas .  The\\n       related theorems are provided later, see ~ gsumvalx .
