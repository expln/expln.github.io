Definition of Moore\\n       closure in [Schechter] p. 79.  This generalizes topological closure\\n       ( ~ mrccls ) and linear span ( ~ mrclsp ).\\n\\n       A Moore closure operation ` N ` is (1) extensive, i.e.,\\n       ` x C_ ( N `` x ) ` for all subsets ` x ` of the base set ( ~ mrcssid ),\\n       (2) isotone, i.e., ` x C_ y ` implies that ` ( N `` x ) C_ ( N `` y ) `\\n       for all subsets ` x ` and ` y ` of the base set ( ~ mrcss ), and (3)\\n       idempotent, i.e., ` ( N `` ( N `` x ) ) = ( N `` x ) ` for all subsets\\n       ` x ` of the base set ( ~ mrcidm .)  Operators satisfying these three\\n       properties are in bijective correspondence with Moore collections, so\\n       these properties may be used to give an alternate characterization of a\\n       Moore collection by providing a closure operation ` N ` on the set of\\n       subsets of a given base set which satisfies (1), (2), and (3); the\\n       closed sets can be recovered as those sets which equal their closures\\n       (Section 4.5 in [Schechter] p. 82.)
