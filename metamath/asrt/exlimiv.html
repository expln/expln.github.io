See, for example, Rule C in [Mendelson] p. 81, Rule C\\n       in [Margaris] p. 40, or Rule C in Hirst and Hirst's _A Primer for Logic\\n       and Proof_ p. 59 (PDF p. 65) at\\n       ~ http://www.appstate.edu/~~hirstjl/primer/hirst.pdf .  In informal\\n       proofs, the statement \\\"Let ` C ` be an element such that...\\\" almost\\n       always means an implicit application of Rule C.\\n\\n       In essence, Rule C states that if we can prove that some element ` x `\\n       exists satisfying a wff, i.e. ` E. x ph ( x ) ` where ` ph ( x ) ` has\\n       ` x ` free, then we can use ` ph ( C ) ` as a hypothesis for the proof\\n       where ` C ` is a new (fictitious) constant not appearing previously in\\n       the proof, nor in any axioms used, nor in the theorem to be proved.  The\\n       purpose of Rule C is to get rid of the existential quantifier.\\n\\n       We cannot do this in Metamath directly.  Instead, we use the original\\n       ` ph ` (containing ` x ` ) as an antecedent for the main part of the\\n       proof.  We eventually arrive at ` ( ph -> ps ) ` where ` ps ` is the\\n       theorem to be proved and does not contain ` x ` .  Then we apply\\n       ~ exlimiv to arrive at ` ( E. x ph -> ps ) ` .  Finally, we separately\\n       prove ` E. x ph ` and detach it with modus ponens ~ ax-mp to arrive at\\n       the final theorem ` ps ` .  (Contributed by NM, 21-Jun-1993.)
