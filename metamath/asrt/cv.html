This can be justified informally as follows.  We know that\\n       the class builder ` { y | y e. x } ` is a class by ~ cab .  Since (when\\n       ` y ` is distinct from ` x ` ) we have ` x = { y | y e. x } ` by\\n       ~ cvjust , we can argue that the syntax \\\" ` class x ` \\\" can be viewed as\\n       an abbreviation for \\\" ` class { y | y e. x } ` \\\".  See the discussion\\n       under the definition of class in [Jech] p. 4 showing that \\\"Every set can\\n       be considered to be a class.\\\"\\n\\n       While it is tempting and perhaps occasionally useful to view ~ cv as a\\n       \\\"type conversion\\\" from a setvar variable to a class variable, keep in\\n       mind that ~ cv is intrinsically no different from any other\\n       class-building syntax such as ~ cab , ~ cun , or ~ c0 .\\n\\n       For a general discussion of the theory of classes and the role of ~ cv ,\\n       see ~ mmset.html#class .\\n\\n       (The description above applies to set theory, not predicate calculus.\\n       The purpose of introducing ` class x ` here, and not in set theory where\\n       it belongs, is to allow us to express i.e.  \\\"prove\\\" the ~ weq of\\n       predicate calculus from the ~ wceq of set theory, so that we don't\\n       overload the ` = ` connective with two syntax definitions.  This is done\\n       to prevent ambiguity that would complicate some Metamath parsers.)\",\"v\":\"#$\",\"pa\":\"\",\"r\":\"%#\"}")
