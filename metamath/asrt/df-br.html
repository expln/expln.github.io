Note that the syntax is simply three\\n     class symbols in a row.  Definition 6.18 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 29\\n     generalized to arbitrary classes.  Class ` R ` often denotes a relation\\n     such as \\\" ` < ` \\\" that compares two classes ` A ` and ` B ` , which might\\n     be numbers such as ` 1 ` and ` 2 ` (see ~ df-ltxr for the specific\\n     definition of ` < ` ).  As a wff, relations are true or false.  For\\n     example, ` ( R = { <. 2 , 6 >. , <. 3 , 9 >. } -> 3 R 9 ) ` ( ~ ex-br ).\\n     Often class ` R ` meets the ` Rel ` criteria to be defined in ~ df-rel ,\\n     and in particular ` R ` may be a function (see ~ df-fun ).  This\\n     definition of relations is well-defined, although not very meaningful,\\n     when classes ` A ` and/or ` B ` are proper classes (i.e. are not sets).\\n     On the other hand, we often find uses for this definition when ` R ` is a\\n     proper class (see for example ~ iprc ).
