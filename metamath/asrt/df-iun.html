In\\n       most applications, ` A ` is independent of ` x ` (although this is not\\n       required by the definition), and ` B ` depends on ` x ` i.e. can be read\\n       informally as ` B ( x ) ` .  We call ` x ` the index, ` A ` the index\\n       set, and ` B ` the indexed set.  In most books, ` x e. A ` is written as\\n       a subscript or underneath a union symbol ` U. ` .  We use a special\\n       union symbol ` U_ ` to make it easier to distinguish from plain class\\n       union.  In many theorems, you will see that ` x ` and ` A ` are in the\\n       same distinct variable group (meaning ` A ` cannot depend on ` x ` ) and\\n       that ` B ` and ` x ` do not share a distinct variable group (meaning\\n       that can be thought of as ` B ( x ) ` i.e. can be substituted with a\\n       class expression containing ` x ` ).  An alternate definition tying\\n       indexed union to ordinary union is ~ dfiun2 .  Theorem ~ uniiun provides\\n       a definition of ordinary union in terms of indexed union.  Theorems\\n       ~ fniunfv and ~ funiunfv are useful when ` B ` is a function.\\n       (Contributed by NM, 27-Jun-1998.)\",\"v\":\"#($(&)')\",\"pa\":\"\",\"r\":\"+.$%'&0-#,/$%'#%&*\"}")
