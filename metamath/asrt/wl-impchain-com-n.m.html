The theorem names follow a pattern wl-impchain-com-n.m\\n     with integral numbers n < m, that swaps the m-th antecedent with n-th one\\n     in an implication chain.  It is sufficient to restrict the length of the\\n     chain to m, too, since the consequent can be assumed to be the tail right\\n     of the m-th antecedent of any arbitrary sized implication chain.  We\\n     further assume n > 1, since the ~ wl-impchain-com-1.x series already\\n     covers the special case n = 1.\\n\\n     Being able to swap any two antecedents in an implication chain lays the\\n     foundation of permuting its antecedents arbitrarily.\\n\\n     The proofs of this series aim at automated proofing using a simple scheme.\\n     Any instance of this series is a triple step of swapping the first and\\n     n-th antecedent, then the first and the m-th, then the first and the n-th\\n     antecedent again.  Each of these steps is an instance of the\\n     ~ wl-impchain-com-1.x series.  (Contributed by Wolf Lammen,\\n     17-Nov-2019.)\",\"v\":\"\",\"pa\":\"\",\"r\":\"#$\",\"p\":[\"1¦¦3¦2¦¦0¦#$¦¦#$\"]}")
