For example, ` ( cos `` 0 ) = 1 ` (we prove this in ~ cos0\\n       after we define cosine in ~ df-cos ).  Typically, function ` F ` is\\n       defined using maps-to notation (see ~ df-mpt and ~ df-mpt2 ), but this\\n       is not required.  For example,\\n       ` F = { <. 2 , 6 >. , <. 3 , 9 >. } -> ( F `` 3 ) = 9 ` ( ~ ex-fv ).\\n       Note that ~ df-ov will define two-argument functions using ordered pairs\\n       as ` ( A F B ) = ( F `` <. A , B >. ) ` .  This particular definition is\\n       quite convenient: it can be applied to any class and evaluates to the\\n       empty set when it is not meaningful (as shown by ~ ndmfv and ~ fvprc ).\\n       The left apostrophe notation originated with Peano and was adopted in\\n       Definition *30.01 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 235, Definition 10.11 of\\n       [Quine] p. 68, and Definition 6.11 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 26.  It means\\n       the same thing as the more familiar ` F ( A ) ` notation for a\\n       function's value at ` A ` , i.e.  \\\" ` F ` of ` A ` ,\\\" but without\\n       context-dependent notational ambiguity.  Alternate definitions are\\n       ~ dffv2 , ~ dffv3 , ~ fv2 , and ~ fv3 (the latter two previously\\n       required ` A ` to be a set.)  Restricted equivalents that require ` F `\\n       to be a function are shown in ~ funfv and ~ funfv2 .  For the familiar\\n       definition of function value in terms of ordered pair membership, see\\n       ~ funopfvb .  (Contributed by NM, 1-Aug-1994.)  Revised to use\\n       ` iota ` .  Original version is now theorem ~ dffv4 .  (Revised by Scott\\n       Fenton, 6-Oct-2017.)\",\"v\":\"#*$&%&\",\"pa\":\"\",\"r\":\")($,%'-(+#%$#'\"}")
