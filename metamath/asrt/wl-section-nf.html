In\\n       particular, it often drags axioms ~ ax-10 and ~ ax-12 into proofs, that\\n       are not needed otherwise.  This is because of the particular structure\\n       of the term ` A. x ( ph -> A. x ph ) ` .  It does not allow an easy\\n       transition ` ph ` --> ` -. ph ` (see ~ nfn ).  The mix of both\\n       quantified and simple ` ph ` requires explicit use of ~ sp (or ~ ax-12 )\\n       in many instances.  And, finally, the nesting of the quantifier ` A. x `\\n       sometimes requires an invocation of theorems like ~ nfa1 .  All of this\\n       mandates the use of ~ ax-10 and/or ~ ax-12 .\\n\\n       On the other hand, the current definition is structurally better aligned\\n       with both the hb* series of theorems and ~ ax-5 .\\n\\n       A note on ~ ax-10 :  The obvious content of this axiom is, that the\\n       ` -. ` operator does not change the not-free state of a set varable.\\n       This is in fact only one aspect of this axiom.  The other one, more\\n       hidden, states that ` x ` is not free in ` A. x ph ` .  A simple\\n       transformation renders this axiom as ` ( E. x A. x ph -> A. x ph ) ` ,\\n       from which the second aspect is better deduced.  Both aspects are not\\n       needed in simple applications of the ~ df-nf style definition, while use\\n       of the current ~ nf5 incurs these.\\n\\n       A note on ~ ax-12 :  This axiom enters proofs using ` F/ ` via ~ sp or\\n       ~ 19.8a or their variants.  In a context where both mixed quantified and\\n       simple variables ` ph ` appear (like ~ 19.21 ), this axiom is almost\\n       always required, no matter how 'not free' is defined.  But in a context,\\n       where a variable ` ph ` appears only quantified, chances are, this axiom\\n       can be evaded when using ~ df-nf , but not when using ~ nf5 .\\n\\n       (Contributed by Wolf Lammen, 11-Sep-2021.)
