An axiom scheme of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.\\n       Axiom 5 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 19.  It tells us that the image of any set\\n       under a function is also a set (see the variant ~ funimaex ).  Although\\n       ` ph ` may be any wff whatsoever, this axiom is useful (i.e. its\\n       antecedent is satisfied) when we are given some function and ` ph `\\n       encodes the predicate \\\"the value of the function at ` w ` is ` z ` .\\\"\\n       Thus, ` ph ` will ordinarily have free variables ` w ` and ` z ` - think\\n       of it informally as ` ph ( w , z ) ` .  We prefix ` ph ` with the\\n       quantifier ` A. y ` in order to \\\"protect\\\" the axiom from any ` ph `\\n       containing ` y ` , thus allowing us to eliminate any restrictions on\\n       ` ph ` .  Another common variant is derived as ~ axrep5 , where you can\\n       find some further remarks.  A slightly more compact version is shown as\\n       ~ axrep2 .  A quite different variant is ~ zfrep6 , which if used in\\n       place of ~ ax-rep would also require that the Separation Scheme ~ axsep\\n       be stated as a separate axiom.\\n\\n       There is a very strong generalization of Replacement that doesn't demand\\n       function-like behavior of ` ph ` .  Two versions of this generalization\\n       are called the Collection Principle ~ cp and the Boundedness Axiom\\n       ~ bnd .\\n\\n       Many developments of set theory distinguish the uses of Replacement from\\n       uses of the weaker axioms of Separation ~ axsep , Null Set ~ axnul , and\\n       Pairing ~ axpr , all of which we derive from Replacement.  In order to\\n       make it easier to identify the uses of those redundant axioms, we\\n       restate them as axioms ~ ax-sep , ~ ax-nul , and ~ ax-pr below the\\n       theorems that prove them.
