Our definition is a generalization\\n     to classes.

Some authors denote the successor operation\\n     with a prime (apostrophe-like) symbol, such as Definition 6 of [Suppes]\\n     p. 134 and the definition of successor in [Mendelson] p. 246 (who uses the\\n     symbol \\\"Suc\\\" as a predicate to mean \\\"is a successor ordinal\\\").  The\\n     definition of successor of [Enderton] p. 68 denotes the operation with a\\n     plus-sign superscript.
