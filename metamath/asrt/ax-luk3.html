Copy of\\n     ~ luk-3 and ~ pm2.24 , but introduced as an axiom.\\n\\n     One might think that the similar ~ pm2.21 ` ( -. ph -> ( ph -> ps ) ) ` is\\n     a valid replacement for this axiom.  But this is not true, ~ ax-3 is not\\n     derivable from this modification.\\n\\n     This can be shown by designing carefully operators ` -. ` and ` -> ` on a\\n     finite set of primitive statements.  In propositional logic such\\n     statements are ` T. ` and ` F. ` , but we can assume more and other\\n     primitives in our universe of statements. So we denote our primitive\\n     statements as phi0 , phi1 and phi2.  The actual meaning of the statements\\n     are not important in this context, it rather counts how they behave under\\n     our operations ` -. ` and ` -> ` , and which of them we assume to hold\\n     unconditionally (phi1, phi2).  For our disproving model, I give that\\n     information in tabular form below.  The interested reader may check per\\n     hand, that all possible interpretations of ~ ax-mp , ~ ax-luk1 , ~ ax-luk2\\n     and ~ pm2.21 result in phi1 or phi2, meaning they always hold.  But for\\n     ~ wl-ax3 we can find a counter example resulting in phi0, not a statement\\n     always true.\\n\\n     The verification of a particular set of axioms in a given model is tedious\\n     and error prone, so I wrote a computer program, first checking this for\\n     me,\\n     and second, hunting for a counter example.
