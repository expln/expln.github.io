Elements of a Moore collection\\n       are termed _closed_; Moore collections generalize the notion of\\n       closedness from topologies ( ~ cldmre ) and vector spaces ( ~ lssmre )\\n       to the most general setting in which such concepts make sense.\\n       Definition of Moore collection of sets in [Schechter] p. 78.  A Moore\\n       collection may also be called a _closure system_ (Section 0.6 in\\n       [Gratzer] p. 23.)  The name _Moore collection_ is after Eliakim Hastings\\n       Moore, who discussed these systems in Part I of [Moore] p. 53 to 76.\\n\\n       See ~ ismre , ~ mresspw , ~ mre1cl and ~ mreintcl for the major\\n       properties of a Moore collection.
