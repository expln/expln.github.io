This theorem requires\\n       ~ ax-ext , ~ df-clab , ~ df-cleq , ~ df-clel , but to prove that any\\n       specific class term not containing class variables is a setvar or can be\\n       written as (is equal to) a class abstraction does not require these\\n       $a-statements.  This last fact is a metatheorem, consequence of the fact\\n       that the only $a-statements with typecode ` class ` are ~ cv , ~ cab and\\n       statements corresponding to defined class constructors.\\n\\n       UPDATE:  This theorem is (almost) ~ abid2 and ~ bj-abid2 , though the\\n       present proof is shorter than a proof from ~ bj-abid2 and ~ eqcomi (and\\n       is shorter than the proof of either); plus, it is of the same form as\\n       ~ cvjust and such a basic statement deserves to be present in both\\n       forms.
