Proposition 4.14 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 14.\\n\\n       In the late 1800s, Frege's Axiom of (unrestricted) Comprehension,\\n       expressed in our notation as ` A e. _V ` , asserted that any collection\\n       of sets ` A ` is a set i.e. belongs to the universe ` _V ` of all sets.\\n       In particular, by substituting ` { x | x e/ x } ` (the \\\"Russell class\\\")\\n       for ` A ` , it asserted ` { x | x e/ x } e. _V ` , meaning that the\\n       \\\"collection of all sets which are not members of themselves\\\" is a set.\\n       However, here we prove ` { x | x e/ x } e/ _V ` .  This contradiction\\n       was discovered by Russell in 1901 (published in 1903), invalidating the\\n       Comprehension Axiom and leading to the collapse of Frege's system.\\n\\n       In 1908, Zermelo rectified this fatal flaw by replacing Comprehension\\n       with a weaker Subset (or Separation) Axiom ~ ssex asserting that ` A `\\n       is a set only when it is smaller than some other set ` B ` .  However,\\n       Zermelo was then faced with a \\\"chicken and egg\\\" problem of how to show\\n       ` B ` is a set, leading him to introduce the set-building axioms of Null\\n       Set ~ 0ex , Pairing ~ prex , Union ~ uniex , Power Set ~ pwex , and\\n       Infinity ~ omex to give him some starting sets to work with (all of\\n       which, before Russell's Paradox, were immediate consequences of Frege's\\n       Comprehension).  In 1922 Fraenkel strengthened the Subset Axiom with our\\n       present Replacement Axiom ~ funimaex (whose modern formalization is due\\n       to Skolem, also in 1922).  Thus, in a very real sense Russell's Paradox\\n       spawned the invention of ZF set theory and completely revised the\\n       foundations of mathematics!\\n\\n       Another mainstream formalization of set theory, devised by von Neumann,\\n       Bernays, and Goedel, uses class variables rather than setvar variables\\n       as its primitives.  The axiom system NBG in [Mendelson] p. 225 is\\n       suitable for a Metamath encoding.  NBG is a conservative extension of ZF\\n       in that it proves exactly the same theorems as ZF that are expressible\\n       in the language of ZF. An advantage of NBG is that it is finitely\\n       axiomatizable - the Axiom of Replacement can be broken down into a\\n       finite set of formulas that eliminate its wff metavariable.  Finite\\n       axiomatizability is required by some proof languages (although not by\\n       Metamath).  There is a stronger version of NBG called Morse-Kelley\\n       (axiom system MK in [Mendelson] p. 287).\\n\\n       Russell himself continued in a different direction, avoiding the paradox\\n       with his \\\"theory of types.\\\"  Quine extended Russell's ideas to formulate\\n       his New Foundations set theory (axiom system NF of [Quine] p. 331).  In\\n       NF, the collection of all sets is a set, contradicting ZF and NBG set\\n       theories, and it has other bizarre consequences: when sets become too\\n       huge (beyond the size of those used in standard mathematics), the Axiom\\n       of Choice ~ ac4 and Cantor's Theorem ~ canth are provably false!  (See\\n       ~ ncanth for some intuition behind the latter.)  Recent results (as of\\n       2014) seem to show that NF is equiconsistent to Z (ZF in which ~ ax-sep\\n       replaces ~ ax-rep ) with ~ ax-sep restricted to only bounded\\n       quantifiers.  NF is finitely axiomatizable and can be encoded in\\n       Metamath using the axioms from T. Hailperin, \\\"A set of axioms for\\n       logic,\\\" _J. Symb.  Logic_ 9:1-19 (1944).\\n\\n       Under our ZF set theory, every set is a member of the Russell class by\\n       ~ elirrv (derived from the Axiom of Regularity), so for us the Russell\\n       class equals the universe ` _V ` (theorem ~ ruv ).  See ~ ruALT for an\\n       alternate proof of ~ ru derived from that fact.
