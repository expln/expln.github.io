See also the section\\n     comment and the comment of ~ bj-0 .  Since ~ bj-0 is used in a\\n     non-essential step, this use does not appear on this webpage (but the\\n     present theorem appears on the webpage for ~ bj-0 as a theorem referencing\\n     it).  The full proof reads $= wph wps wch bj-0 id $.  (while, without\\n     using ~ bj-0 , it would read $= wph wps wi wch wi id $.).\\n\\n     Now we explain why syntactic theorems are not useful in set.mm.  Suppose\\n     that the syntactic theorem thm-0 proves that PHI is a well-formed formula,\\n     and that thm-0 is used to shorten the proof of thm-1.  Assume that PHI\\n     does have proper non-atomic subformulas (which is not the case of the\\n     formula proved by ~ weq or ~ wel ).  Then, the proof of thm-1 does not\\n     construct all the proper non-atomic subformulas of PHI (if it did, then\\n     using thm-0 would not shorten it).  Therefore, thm-1 is a special instance\\n     of a more general theorem with essentially the same proof.  In the present\\n     case, ~ bj-1 is a special instance of ~ id .
