See e.g.  Rule 1 of [Hamilton] p. 73.  The rule says, \\\"if\\n       ` ph ` is true, and ` ph ` implies ` ps ` , then ` ps ` must also be\\n       true.\\\"  This rule is sometimes called \\\"detachment,\\\" since it detaches\\n       the minor premise from the major premise.  \\\"Modus ponens\\\" is short for\\n       \\\"modus ponendo ponens,\\\" a Latin phrase that means \\\"the mode that by\\n       affirming affirms\\\" - remark in [Sanford] p. 39.
