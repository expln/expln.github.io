Alternate proof of ~ sucid .\\n       The following User's Proof is a Virtual Deduction proof\\n       completed automatically by the tools program\\n       completeusersproof.cmd, which invokes Mel L. O'Cat's mmj2 and Norm\\n       Megill's Metamath Proof Assistant.  ~ sucidALT is ~ sucidALTVD\\n       without virtual deductions and was automatically derived from\\n       ~ sucidALTVD . This proof illustrates that\\n       completeusersproof.cmd will generate a Metamath proof from any\\n       User's Proof which is \\\"conventional\\\" in the sense that no step\\n       is a virtual deduction, provided that all necessary unification\\n       theorems and transformation deductions are in set.mm.\\n       completeusersproof.cmd automatically converts such a\\n       conventional proof into a Virtual Deduction proof for which each\\n       step happens to be a 0-virtual hypothesis virtual deduction.\\n       The user does not need to search for reference theorem labels or\\n       deduction labels nor does he(she) need to use theorems and\\n       deductions which unify with reference theorems and deductions in\\n       set.mm.  All that is necessary is that each theorem or deduction\\n       of the User's Proof unifies with some reference theorem or\\n       deduction in set.mm or is a semantic variation of some theorem\\n       or deduction which unifies with some reference theorem or\\n       deduction in set.mm.  The definition of \\\"semantic variation\\\" has\\n       not been precisely defined.  If it is obvious that a theorem or\\n       deduction has the same meaning as another theorem or deduction,\\n       then it is a semantic variation of the latter theorem or\\n       deduction.  For example, step 4 of the User's Proof is a\\n       semantic variation of the definition (axiom)\\n       ` suc A = ( A u. { A } ) ` , which unifies with ~ df-suc , a\\n       reference definition (axiom) in set.mm.  Also, a theorem or\\n       deduction is said to be a semantic variation of another\\n       theorem or deduction if it is obvious upon cursory inspection\\n       that it has the same meaning as a weaker form of the latter\\n       theorem or deduction.  For example, the deduction ` Ord A `\\n       infers  ` A. x e. A A. y e. A ( x e. y \\\\/ x = y \\\\/ y e. x ) ` is a\\n       semantic variation of the theorem ` ( Ord A <-> ( Tr A /\\\\ A. x e. A `\\n       ` A. y e. A ( x e. y \\\\/ x = y \\\\/ y e. x ) ) ) ` , which unifies with\\n       the set.mm reference definition (axiom) ~ dford2 .\\n       <HTML> <TABLE>\\n       <TR> <TD> h1::     <TD> ` |- A e. _V   `\\n       <TR> <TD> 2:1:     <TD> ` |- A e. { A } `\\n       <TR> <TD> 3:2:     <TD> ` |- A e.
