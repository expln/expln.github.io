This relation is merely\\n     the converse of the 'less than or equal to' relation defined by ~ df-le .\\n\\n     We do not write this as ` ( x >_ y <-> y <_ x ) ` , and similarly we do\\n     not write `` > `` as ` ( x > y <-> y < x ) ` , because these are not\\n     definitional axioms as understood by mmj2 (those definitions will be\\n     flagged as being \\\"potentially non-conservative\\\").  We could write them\\n     this way:\\n     ` |- > = { <. x , y >. | ( ( x e. RR* /\\\\ y e. RR* ) /\\\\ y < x ) } ` and\\n     ` |- >_ = { <. x , y >. | ( ( x e. RR* /\\\\ y e.

This definition of ` >_ ` , and the similar\\n     one for ` > ` ( ~ df-gt ), are a bit strange when you see them for the\\n     first time, but these definitions are much simpler for us to process and\\n     are clearly conservative definitions.  (My thanks to Mario Carneiro for\\n     pointing out this simpler approach.)  See ~ gte-lte for a more\\n     conventional expression of the relationship between ` < ` and ` > ` .  As\\n     a stylistic issue, set.mm prefers 'less than' instead of 'greater than' to\\n     reduce the number of conversion steps.  Thus, we discourage its use, but\\n     include its definition so that there _is_ a formal definition of this\\n     symbol.\\n\\n     (Contributed by David A.
