This axiom\\n       is the gateway to \\\"Cantor's paradise\\\" (an expression coined by Hilbert).\\n       It asserts that given a starting set ` x ` , an infinite set ` y ` built\\n       from it exists.  Although our version is apparently not given in the\\n       literature, it is similar to, but slightly shorter than, the Axiom of\\n       Infinity in [FreydScedrov] p. 283 (see ~ inf1 and ~ inf2 ).  More\\n       standard versions, which essentially state that there exists a set\\n       containing all the natural numbers, are shown as ~ zfinf2 and ~ omex and\\n       are based on the (nontrivial) proof of ~ inf3 .  This version has the\\n       advantage that when expanded to primitives, it has fewer symbols than\\n       the standard version ~ ax-inf2 .  Theorem ~ inf0 shows the reverse\\n       derivation of our axiom from a standard one.  Theorem ~ inf5 shows a\\n       very short way to state this axiom.\\n\\n       The standard version of Infinity ~ ax-inf2 requires this axiom along\\n       with Regularity ~ ax-reg for its derivation (as theorem ~ axinf2 below).\\n       In order to more easily identify the normal uses of Regularity, we will\\n       usually reference ~ ax-inf2 instead of this one.  The derivation of this\\n       axiom from ~ ax-inf2 is shown by theorem ~ axinf .\\n\\n       Proofs should normally use the standard version ~ ax-inf2 instead of\\n       this axiom.
