For example,\\n       ` ( 1 . 5 ) = ( 3 / 2 ) ` , and\\n       ` -u ( ; 3 2 . _ 7 _ 1 8 ) = -u ( ; ; ; ; 3 2 7 1 8 / ; ; ; 1 0 0 0 ) `\\n       Unary minus, if applied, should normally be applied in front of the\\n       parentheses.\\n\\n       Metamath intentionally does not have a built-in construct for numbers,\\n       so it can show that numbers are something you can build based on set\\n       theory.  However, that means that metamath has no built-in way to handle\\n       decimal numbers as traditionally written, e.g., \\\"2.54\\\", and its parsing\\n       system intentionally does not include the complexities necessary to\\n       define such a parsing system.  Here we create a system for modeling\\n       traditional decimal point notation; it is not syntactically identical,\\n       but it is sufficiently similar so it is a reasonable model of decimal\\n       point notation.  It should also serve as a convenient way to write some\\n       fractional numbers.\\n\\n       The RHS is ` RR ` , not ` QQ ` ; this should simplify some proofs.  The\\n       LHS is ` NN0 ` , since that is what is used in practice.  The definition\\n       intentionally does not allow negative numbers on the LHS; if it did,\\n       nonzero fractions would produce the wrong results.  (It would be\\n       possible to define the decimal point to do this, but using it would be\\n       more complicated, and the expression ` -u ( A . B ) ` is just as\\n       convenient.)
