It\\n     appears as Axiom scheme C15' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).\\n     It is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105,\\n     from which it can be proved by cases.  To understand this theorem more\\n     easily, think of \\\" ` -. A. x x = y -> ` ...\\\" as informally meaning \\\"if\\n     ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct variables then...\\\"  The antecedent becomes\\n     false if the same variable is substituted for ` x ` and ` y ` , ensuring\\n     the theorem is sound whenever this is the case.  In some later theorems,\\n     we call an antecedent of the form ` -. A. x x = y ` a \\\"distinctor.\\\"\\n\\n     Interestingly, if the wff expression substituted for ` ph ` contains no\\n     wff variables, the resulting statement _can_ be proved without invoking\\n     this axiom.  This means that even though this axiom is _metalogically_\\n     independent from the others, it is not _logically_ independent.\\n     Specifically, we can prove any wff-variable-free instance of axiom\\n     ~ ax-c15 (from which the ~ ax-12 instance follows by theorem ~ ax12 .)\\n     The proof is by induction on formula length, using ~ ax12eq and ~ ax12el\\n     for the basis steps and ~ ax12indn , ~ ax12indi , and ~ ax12inda for the\\n     induction steps.  (This paragraph is true provided we use ~ ax-c11 in\\n     place of ~ ax-c11n .)\\n\\n     This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used.  It is proved above\\n     as theorem ~ axc15 , which should be used instead.  (Contributed by NM,\\n     14-May-1993.)
