This can happen, for\\n       example, when the antecedent is set membership but the set is the empty\\n       set (e.g., ` x e. M ` and ` M = (/) ` ).\\n\\n       This is perhaps best explained using an example.  The sentence \\\"All\\n       Martians are green\\\" would typically be represented formally using the\\n       expression ` A. x ( ph -> ps ) ` .  In this expression ` ph ` is true\\n       iff ` x ` is a Martian and ` ps ` is true iff ` x ` is green.\\n       Similarly, \\\"All Martians are not green\\\" would typically be represented\\n       as ` A. x ( ph -> -. ps ) ` .  However, if there are no Martians\\n       ( ` -. E. x ph ` ), then both of those expressions are _true_.  That is\\n       surprising to the inexperienced, because the two expressions seem to be\\n       the opposite of each other.  The reason this occurs is because in\\n       classical logic the implication ` ( ph -> ps ) ` is equivalent to\\n       ` -. ph \\\\/ ps ` (as proven in ~ imor ).  When ` ph ` is always false,\\n       ` -. ph ` is always true, and an _or_ with true is always true.\\n\\n       Here are a few technical notes.  In this notation, ` ph ` and ` ps ` are\\n       predicates that return a true or false value and may depend on ` x ` .\\n       We only say _may_ because it actually doesn't matter for our proof.  In\\n       metamath this simply means that we do not require that ` ph ` , ` ps ` ,\\n       and ` x ` be distinct (so ` x ` can be part of ` ph ` or ` ps ` ).\\n\\n       In natural language the term \\\"implies\\\" often presumes that the\\n       antecedent _can_ occur in at one least circumstance _and_ that there is\\n       some sort of causality.  However, exactly what causality means is\\n       complex and situation-dependent.  Modern logic typically uses material\\n       implication instead; this has a rigorous definition, but it is important\\n       for new users of formal notation to precisely understand it.  There are\\n       ways to solve this, e.g., expressly stating that the antecedent exists\\n       (see ~ alimp-no-surprise ) or using the allsome quantifier\\n       ( ~ df-alsi ) .\\n\\n       For other \\\"surprises\\\" for new users of classical logic, see\\n       ~ empty-surprise and ~ eximp-surprise .
