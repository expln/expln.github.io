Thus, it is possible for a subset of a ring to be a ring\\n       while not containing the true identity if it contains a false identity.\\n       For instance, the subset ` ( ZZ X. { 0 } ) ` of ` ( ZZ X. ZZ ) ` (where\\n       multiplication is component-wise) contains the false identity\\n       ` <. 1 , 0 >. ` which preserves every element of the subset and thus\\n       appears to be the identity of the subset, but is not the identity of the\\n       larger ring.
