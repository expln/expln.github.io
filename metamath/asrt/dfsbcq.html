Since our ~ df-sbc does\\n     not result in the same behavior as Quine's for proper classes, if we\\n     wished to avoid conflict with Quine's definition we could start with this\\n     theorem and ~ dfsbcq2 instead of ~ df-sbc .  ( ~ dfsbcq2 is needed because\\n     unlike Quine we do not overload the ~ df-sb syntax.)  As a consequence of\\n     these theorems, we can derive ~ sbc8g , which is a weaker version of\\n     ~ df-sbc that leaves substitution undefined when ` A ` is a proper class.\\n\\n     However, it is often a nuisance to have to prove the sethood hypothesis of\\n     ~ sbc8g , so we will allow direct use of ~ df-sbc after theorem ~ sbc2or\\n     below.  Proper substitution with a proper class is rarely needed, and when\\n     it is, we can simply use the expansion of Quine's definition.\\n     (Contributed by NM, 14-Apr-1995.)\",\"v\":\"#($'%4&(7'8'9':';(\",\"pa\":\"\",\"r\":\"2*#5&6*0#1%/$30&1%/$))\",\"p\":[\"1¦¦25¦36¦¦0¦¦¦(#\",\"2¦¦25¦35¦¦0¦¦¦(&\",\"3¦$%¦0¦31¦(# (&¦2¦'#5&¦# # & &¦'#5&\",\"5¦¦25¦30¦¦0¦¦¦'$\",\"6¦¦25¦32¦¦0¦¦¦4%\",\"7¦()¦0¦34¦'$ 4%¦2¦(-%,$+¦$ $ % %¦(-%,$+\",\"8¦$*¦0¦27¦(# (&¦2¦'#.&¦# # & -%,$+¦'#.-%,$+\",\"10¦%*¦0¦27¦(# (&¦2¦'#.&¦# & & -%,$+¦'&.-%,$+\",\"14¦()$¦0¦26¦'$ 4% (#¦3¦'0#1%/$¦# # $ $ % %¦'0#1%/$\",\"18¦()%¦0¦26¦'$ 4% (#¦3¦'0#1%/$¦# & $ $ % %¦'0&1%/$\",\"21¦$%*¦29¦33¦(# (& (;¦3¦2*#5&6*#.;3&.;))¦# # & & ; -%,$+¦2*#5&6*#.-%,$+3&.-%,$+))\",\"25¦()$¦0¦28¦'$ 4% (#¦3¦2*0#1%/$3#.-%,$+)¦# # $ $ % %¦2*0#1%/$3#.-%,$+)\",\"29¦()%¦0¦28¦'$ 4% (#¦3¦2*0#1%/$3#.-%,$+)¦# & $ $ % %¦2*0&1%/$3&.-%,$+)\",\"30¦&+-158<@¦29¦37¦'$ '9 ': '7 '8 2*$6*93:)) 2*739) 2*83:)¦5¦2*$6*738))¦$ #5& 7 0#1%/$ 8 0&1%/$ 9 #.-%,$+ : &.-%,$+¦2*#5&6*0#1%/$30&1%/$))\"]}")
