The value of\\n     ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` is ` ps ` if ` ph ` is true and ` ch ` if ` ph `\\n     false.  See ~ dfifp2 , ~ dfifp3 , ~ dfifp4 , ~ dfifp5 , ~ dfifp6 and\\n     ~ dfifp7 for alternate definitions.\\n\\n     This definition (in the form of ~ dfifp2 ) appears in Section II.24 of\\n     [Church] p. 129 (Definition D12 page 132), where it is called \\\"conditioned\\n     disjunction\\\".  Church's ` [ ps , ph , ch ] ` corresponds to our\\n     ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` (note the permutation of the first two\\n     variables).\\n\\n     Church uses the conditional operator as an intermediate step to prove\\n     completeness of some systems of connectives.  The first result is that the\\n     system ` { if- , T. , F. } ` is complete: for the induction step, consider\\n     a wff with n+1 variables; single out one variable, say ` ph ` ; when one\\n     sets ` ph ` to True (resp.  False), then what remains is a wff of n\\n     variables, so by the induction hypothesis it corresponds to a formula\\n     using only ` { if- , T. , F. } ` , say ` ps ` (resp. ` ch ` ); therefore,\\n     the formula ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` represents the initial wff.  Now,\\n     since ` { -> , -. } ` and similar systems suffice to express\\n     ` if- , T. , F. ` , they are also complete.\\n\\n     (Contributed by BJ, 22-Jun-2019.)\",\"v\":\"%&'&(&\",\"pa\":\"\",\"r\":\"+$,$%*'*(#.$$%)'#-$/%)(###\"}")
