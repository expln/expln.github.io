The final consequent ` A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ` is a way of\\n     expressing \\\" ` y ` substituted for ` x ` in wff ` ph ` \\\" (cf. ~ sb6 ).  It\\n     is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105,\\n     from which it can be proved by cases.\\n\\n     The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-c15 and was replaced with this\\n     shorter ~ ax-12 in Jan. 2007.  The old axiom is proved from this one as\\n     theorem ~ axc15 .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from ~ ax-c15 as\\n     theorem ~ ax12 .\\n\\n     Juha Arpiainen proved the metalogical independence of this axiom (in the\\n     form of the older axiom ~ ax-c15 ) from the others on 19-Jan-2006.  See\\n     item 9a at ~ http://us.metamath.org/award2003.html .\\n\\n     See ~ ax12v and ~ ax12v2 for other equivalents of this axiom that (unlike\\n     this axiom) have distinct variable restrictions.\\n\\n     This axiom scheme is logically redundant (see ~ ax12w ) but is used as an\\n     auxiliary axiom scheme to achieve scheme completeness.
