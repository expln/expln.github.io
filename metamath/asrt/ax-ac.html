The Axiom of Choice (AC) is usually considered an\\n       extension of ZF set theory rather than a proper part of it.  It is\\n       sometimes considered philosophically controversial because it asserts\\n       the existence of a set without telling us what the set is.  ZF set\\n       theory that includes AC is called ZFC.\\n\\n       The unpublished version given here says that given any set ` x ` , there\\n       exists a ` y ` that is a collection of unordered pairs, one pair for\\n       each nonempty member of ` x ` .  One entry in the pair is the member of\\n       ` x ` , and the other entry is some arbitrary member of that member of\\n       ` x ` .  See the rewritten version ~ ac3 for a more detailed\\n       explanation.  Theorem ~ ac2 shows an equivalent written compactly with\\n       restricted quantifiers.\\n\\n       This version was specifically crafted to be short when expanded to\\n       primitives.  Kurt Maes' 5-quantifier version ~ ackm is slightly shorter\\n       when the biconditional of ~ ax-ac is expanded into implication and\\n       negation.  In ~ axac3 we allow the constant ` CHOICE ` to represent the\\n       Axiom of Choice; this simplifies the representation of theorems like\\n       ~ gchac (the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis implies the Axiom of\\n       Choice).\\n\\n       Standard textbook versions of AC are derived as ~ ac8 , ~ ac5 , and\\n       ~ ac7 .  The Axiom of Regularity ~ ax-reg (among others) is used to\\n       derive our version from the standard ones; this reverse derivation is\\n       shown as theorem ~ dfac2 .  Equivalents to AC are the well-ordering\\n       theorem ~ weth and Zorn's lemma ~ zorn .  See ~ ac4 for comments about\\n       stronger versions of AC.\\n\\n       In order to avoid uses of ~ ax-reg for derivation of AC equivalents, we\\n       provide ~ ax-ac2 (due to Kurt Maes), which is equivalent to the standard\\n       AC of textbooks.  The derivation of ~ ax-ac2 from ~ ax-ac is shown by\\n       theorem ~ axac2 , and the reverse derivation by ~ axac .  Therefore, new\\n       proofs should normally use ~ ax-ac2 instead.\\n       (New usage is discouraged.)
