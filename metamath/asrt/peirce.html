This odd-looking theorem is the \\\"difference\\\" between an\\n     intuitionistic system of propositional calculus and a classical system and\\n     is not accepted by intuitionists.

A notable fact about this theorem is that\\n     it requires ~ ax-3 for its proof even though the result has no negation\\n     connectives in it.  (Contributed by NM, 29-Dec-1992.)
