This definition somewhat awkwardly\\n       mixes ` ZZ ` (via ` mzPoly ` ) and ` NN0 ` (to define the zero sets);\\n       the former could be avoided by considering coincidence sets of ` NN0 `\\n       polynomials at the cost of requiring two, and the second is driven by\\n       consistency with our mu-recursive functions and the requirements of the\\n       Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich proof.  Both are avoidable at a\\n       complexity cost.  In particular, it is a consequence of ~ 4sq that\\n       implicitly restricting variables to ` NN0 ` adds no expressive power\\n       over allowing them to range over ` ZZ ` .
