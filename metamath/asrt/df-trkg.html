A Tarski geometry is a set of\\n       points, equipped with a betweenness relation (denoting that a point lies\\n       on a line segment between two other points) and a congruence relation\\n       (denoting equality of line segment lengths).\\n\\n       <HTML>Here, we are using the following:<UL>\\n       <LI> for congruence, ` ( x .- y ) = ( z .- w ) ` where\\n       ` .- = ( dist `` W ) `\\n       <LI> for betweenness, ` y e.
