Tarski classes is a phrase coined by\\n       Grzegorz Bancerek in his article _Tarski's Classes and Ranks_, Journal\\n       of Formalized Mathematics, Vol 1, No 3, May-August 1990.  A Tarski class\\n       is a set whose existence is ensured by Tarski's axiom A (see ~ ax-groth\\n       and the equivalent axioms).  Axiom A was first presented in Tarski's\\n       article _&Uuml;ber unerreichbare Kardinalzahlen_.  Tarski had invented\\n       the axiom A to enable ZFC to manage inaccessible cardinals.  Later\\n       Grothendieck invented the concept of Grothendieck universes and showed\\n       they were equal to transitive Tarski classes.
