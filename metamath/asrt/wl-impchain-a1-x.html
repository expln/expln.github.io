This is expressed in its simplest form in ~ wl-a1i , that allows\\n     us prepending an arbitrary antecedent to an implication chain.  Using our\\n     antecedent swapping theorems described in ~ wl-impchain-com-n.m , we may\\n     then move such a prepended antecedent to any desired location within all\\n     antecedents.  The first series of theorems of this kind adds a single\\n     antecedent somewhere to an implication chain.  The appended number in the\\n     theorem name indicates its position within all antecedents, 1 denoting the\\n     head position.  A second theorem series extends this idea to multiple\\n     additions (TODO).\\n\\n     Adding antecedents to an implication chain usually weakens their\\n     universality.  The consequent afterwards dependends on more conditions\\n     than before, which renders the implication chain less versatile.  So you\\n     find this proof technique mostly when you adjust a chain to a hypothesis\\n     of a rule.  A common case are syllogisms merging two implication chains\\n     into one.\\n\\n     The first elements of the first series correspond to ~ a1i , ~ a1d and\\n     ~ a1dd in the main part.\\n\\n     The proofs of this series aim at automated proving using a simple\\n     recursive scheme.  It employs the previous theorem in the series along\\n     with a sample from the ~ wl-impchain-com-1.x series developed before.\\n     (Contributed by Wolf Lammen, 20-Jun-2020.)\",\"v\":\"\",\"pa\":\"\",\"r\":\"#$\",\"p\":[\"1¦¦3¦2¦¦0¦#$¦¦#$\"]}")
