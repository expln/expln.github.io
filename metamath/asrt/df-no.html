The surreal numbers are a proper\\n       class of numbers developed by John H. Conway and introduced by Donald\\n       Knuth in 1975.  They form a proper class into which all ordered fields\\n       can be embedded.  The approach we take to defining them was first\\n       introduced by Hary Goshnor, and is based on the conception of a \\\"sign\\n       expansion\\\" of a surreal number.  We define the surreals as\\n       ordinal-indexed sequences of ` 1o ` and ` 2o ` , analagous to Goshnor's\\n       ` ( - ) ` and ` ( + ) ` .\\n\\n       After introducing this definition, we will abstract away from it using\\n       axioms that Norman Alling developed in \\\"Foundations of Analysis over\\n       Surreal Number Fields.\\\"  This is done in an effort to be agnostic\\n       towards the exact implementation of surreals.
