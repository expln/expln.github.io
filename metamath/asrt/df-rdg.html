This rather amazing operation allows us to define, with\\n       compact direct definitions, functions that are usually defined in\\n       textbooks only with indirect self-referencing recursive definitions.  A\\n       recursive definition requires advanced metalogic to justify - in\\n       particular, eliminating a recursive definition is very difficult and\\n       often not even shown in textbooks.  On the other hand, the elimination\\n       of a direct definition is a matter of simple mechanical substitution.\\n       The price paid is the daunting complexity of our ` rec ` operation\\n       (especially when ~ df-recs that it is built on is also eliminated).  But\\n       once we get past this hurdle, definitions that would otherwise be\\n       recursive become relatively simple, as in for example ~ oav , from which\\n       we prove the recursive textbook definition as theorems ~ oa0 , ~ oasuc ,\\n       and ~ oalim (with the help of theorems ~ rdg0 , ~ rdgsuc , and\\n       ~ rdglim2a ).  We can also restrict the ` rec ` operation to define\\n       otherwise recursive functions on the natural numbers ` _om ` ; see\\n       ~ fr0g and ~ frsuc .  Our ` rec ` operation apparently does not appear\\n       in published literature, although closely related is Definition 25.2 of\\n       [Quine] p. 177, which he uses to \\\"turn...a recursion into a genuine or\\n       direct definition\\\" (p. 174).  Note that the ` if ` operations (see\\n       ~ df-if ) select cases based on whether the domain of ` g ` is zero, a\\n       successor, or a limit ordinal.\\n\\n       An important use of this definition is in the recursive sequence\\n       generator ~ df-seq on the natural numbers (as a subset of the complex\\n       numbers), allowing us to define, with direct definitions, recursive\\n       infinite sequences such as the factorial function ~ df-fac and integer\\n       powers ~ df-exp .\\n\\n       _Note:  We introduce_ ` rec ` _with the philosophical goal of being_\\n       _able to eliminate all definitions with direct mechanical substitution_\\n       _and to verify easily the soundness of definitions.  Metamath itself_\\n       _has no built-in technical limitation that prevents multiple-part_\\n       _recursive definitions in the traditional textbook style_.
