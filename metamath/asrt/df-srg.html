A semiring is a set equipped with two\\n       everywhere-defined internal operations, whose first one is an additive\\n       commutative monoid structure and the second one is a multiplicative\\n       monoid structure, and where multiplication is (left- and right-)\\n       distributive over addition.  Compared to the definition of a ring, this\\n       definition also adds that the additive identity is an absorbing element\\n       of the multiplicative law, as this cannot be deduced from distributivity\\n       alone.
