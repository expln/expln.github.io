The proof here\\n       is the only one I could find, from\\n       ~ http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm6/fm619.pdf p.94 (writeup by\\n       Tarski, credited to Kuratowski).  Translated into English and modern\\n       notation, the proof proceeds as follows (variables renamed for\\n       uniqueness):\\n\\n       Suppose for a contradiction that ` A ` is a set which is II-finite but\\n       not III-finite.\\n\\n       For any countable sequence of distinct subsets ` T ` of ` A ` , we can\\n       form a decreasing sequence of nonempty subsets ` ( U `` T ) ` by taking\\n       finite intersections of initial segments of ` T ` while skipping over\\n       any element of ` T ` which would cause the intersection to be empty.\\n\\n       By II-finiteness (as ~ fin2i2 ) this sequence contains its intersection,\\n       call it ` Y ` ; since by induction every subset in the sequence ` U ` is\\n       nonempty, the intersection must be nonempty.\\n\\n       Suppose that an element ` X ` of ` T ` has nonempty intersection with\\n       ` Y ` .  Thus, said element has a nonempty intersection with the\\n       corresponding element of ` U ` , therefore it was used in the\\n       construction of ` U ` and all further elements of ` U ` are subsets of\\n       ` X ` , thus ` X ` contains the ` Y ` .  That is, all elements of ` X `\\n       either contain ` Y ` or are disjoint from it.\\n\\n       Since there are only two cases, there must exist an infinite subset of\\n       ` T ` which uniformly either contain ` Y ` or are disjoint from it.  In\\n       the former case we can create an infinite set by subtracting ` Y ` from\\n       each element.  In either case, call the result ` Z ` ; this is an\\n       infinite set of subsets of ` A ` , each of which is disjoint from ` Y `\\n       and contained in the union of ` T ` ; the union of ` Z ` is strictly\\n       contained in the union of ` T ` , because only the latter is a superset\\n       of the nonempty set ` Y ` .\\n\\n       The preceding four steps may be iterated a countable number of times\\n       starting from the assumed denumerable set of subsets to produce a\\n       denumerable sequence ` B ` of the ` T ` sets from each stage.  Great\\n       caution is required to avoid ~ ax-dc here; in particular an effective\\n       version of the pigeonhole principle (for aleph-null pigeons and 2 holes)\\n       is required.  Since a denumerable set of subsets is assumed to exist, we\\n       can conclude ` _om e. _V ` without the axiom.\\n\\n       This ` B ` sequence is strictly decreasing, thus it has no minimum,\\n       contradicting the first assumption.
