One of the equality and substitution axioms of\\n     predicate calculus with equality.  This axiom tells us is that at least\\n     one thing exists.  In this form (not requiring that ` x ` and ` y ` be\\n     distinct) it was used in an axiom system of Tarski (see Axiom B7' in\\n     footnote 1 of [KalishMontague] p. 81.)  It is equivalent to axiom scheme\\n     C10' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint); the equivalence is\\n     established by ~ axc10 and ~ ax6fromc10 .  A more convenient form of this\\n     axiom is ~ ax6e , which has additional remarks.\\n\\n     Raph Levien proved the independence of this axiom from the other logical\\n     axioms on 12-Apr-2005.
