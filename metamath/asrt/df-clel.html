Theorem 6.3 of\\n       [Quine] p. 41, or Proposition 4.6 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 13, which we\\n       adopt as a definition.  See these references for its metalogical\\n       justification.  Note that like ~ df-cleq it extends or \\\"overloads\\\" the\\n       use of the existing membership symbol, but unlike ~ df-cleq it does not\\n       strengthen the set of valid wffs of logic when the class variables are\\n       replaced with setvar variables (see ~ cleljust ), so we don't include\\n       any set theory axiom as a hypothesis.  See also comments about the\\n       syntax under ~ df-clab .  Alternate definitions of ` A e.

The proofs of\\n       conservativity require external justification that is beyond the scope\\n       of the definition checker.\\n\\n       For a general discussion of the theory of classes, see\\n       ~ mmset.html#class .
