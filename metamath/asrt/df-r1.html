Starting with the empty set, this\\n       function builds up layers of sets where the next layer is the power set\\n       of the previous layer (and the union of previous layers when the\\n       argument is a limit ordinal).  Using the Axiom of Regularity, we can\\n       show that any set whatsoever belongs to one of the layers of this\\n       hierarchy (see ~ tz9.13 ).  Our definition expresses Definition 9.9 of\\n       [TakeutiZaring] p. 76 in a closed form, from which we derive the\\n       recursive definition as theorems ~ r10 , ~ r1suc , and ~ r1lim .\\n       Theorem ~ r1val1 shows a recursive definition that works for all values,\\n       and theorems ~ r1val2 and ~ r1val3 show the value expressed in terms of\\n       rank.  Other notations for this function are _R_ with the argument as a\\n       subscript (Equation 3.1 of [BellMachover] p. 477), ` _V ` with a\\n       subscript (Definition of [Enderton] p. 202), _M_ with a subscript\\n       (Definition 15.19 of [Monk1] p. 113), the capital Greek letter psi\\n       (Definition of [Mendelson] p. 281), and bold-face R (Definition 2.1 of\\n       [Kunen] p. 95).
