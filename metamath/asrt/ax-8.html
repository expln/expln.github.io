One of the equality and\\n     substitution axioms for a non-logical predicate in our predicate calculus\\n     with equality.  It substitutes equal variables into the left-hand side of\\n     an arbitrary binary predicate ` e. ` , which we will use for the set\\n     membership relation when set theory is introduced.  This axiom scheme is a\\n     sub-scheme of Axiom Scheme B8 of system S2 of [Tarski], p. 75, whose\\n     general form cannot be represented with our notation.  Also appears as\\n     Axiom scheme C12' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).\\n     \\\"Non-logical\\\" means that the predicate is not a primitive of predicate\\n     calculus proper but instead is an extension to it.  \\\"Binary\\\" means that\\n     the predicate has two arguments.  In a system of predicate calculus with\\n     equality, like ours, equality is not usually considered to be a\\n     non-logical predicate.  In systems of predicate calculus without equality,\\n     it typically would be.\\n\\n     We prove in ~ ax8 that this axiom can be recovered from its weakened\\n     version ~ ax8v where ` x ` and ` y ` are assumed to be disjoint variables.\\n     In particular, the only theorem referencing ~ ax-8 should be ~ ax8v .  See\\n     the comment of ~ ax8v for more details on these matters.  (Contributed by\\n     NM, 30-Jun-1993.)  (Revised by BJ, 7-Dec-2020.)
