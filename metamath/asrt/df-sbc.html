This is\\n     somewhat arbitrary: we could have, instead, chosen the conclusion of\\n     ~ sbc6 for our definition, which always evaluates to true for proper\\n     classes.\\n\\n     Our definition also does not produce the same results as discussed in the\\n     proof of Theorem 6.6 of [Quine] p. 42 (although Theorem 6.6 itself does\\n     hold, as shown by ~ dfsbcq below).  For example, if ` A ` is a proper\\n     class, Quine's substitution of ` A ` for ` y ` in ` 0 e. y ` evaluates to\\n     ` 0 e. A ` rather than our falsehood.  (This can be seen by substituting\\n     ` A ` , ` y ` , and ` 0 ` for alpha, beta, and gamma in Subcase 1 of\\n     Quine's discussion on p. 42.)  Unfortunately, Quine's definition requires\\n     a recursive syntactic breakdown of ` ph ` , and it does not seem possible\\n     to express it with a single closed formula.\\n\\n     If we did not want to commit to any specific proper class behavior, we\\n     could use this definition _only_ to prove theorem ~ dfsbcq , which holds\\n     for both our definition and Quine's, and from which we can derive a weaker\\n     version of ~ df-sbc in the form of ~ sbc8g .  However, the behavior of\\n     Quine's definition at proper classes is similarly arbitrary, and for\\n     practical reasons (to avoid having to prove sethood of ` A ` in every use\\n     of this definition) we allow direct reference to ~ df-sbc and assert that\\n     ` [. A / x ]. ph ` is always false when ` A ` is a proper class.\\n\\n     The theorem ~ sbc2or shows the apparently \\\"strongest\\\" statement we can\\n     make regarding behavior at proper classes if we start from ~ dfsbcq .\\n\\n     The related definition ~ df-csb defines proper substitution into a class\\n     variable (as opposed to a wff variable).
