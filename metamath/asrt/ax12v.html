Besides ~ axc11r , this theorem should be the only one\\n       referencing ~ ax-12 directly.\\n\\n       Both restrictions on variables have their own value.  If for a moment we\\n       assume ` y ` could be set to ` x ` , then, after elimination of the\\n       tautology ` x = x ` , immediately we have ` ph -> A. x ph ` for all\\n       ` ph ` and ` x ` , that is ~ ax-5 , a degenerate result.\\n\\n       The second restriction is not necessary, but a simplification that makes\\n       the following interpretation easier to see.  Since ` ph ` textually at\\n       most depends on ` x ` , we can look at it at some given 'fixed' ` y ` .\\n       This theorem now states that the truth value of ` ph ` will stay\\n       constant, as long as we 'vary ` x ` around ` y ` ' only such that\\n       ` x = y ` still holds.  Or in other words, equality is the finest\\n       grained logical expression.  If you cannot differ two sets by ` = ` ,\\n       you won't find a whatever sophisticated expression that does.  One might\\n       wonder how the described variation of ` x ` is possible at all.  Note\\n       that Metamath is a text processor that easily sees a difference between\\n       text chunks ` { x | -. x = x } ` and ` { y | -. y = y } ` .  Our usual\\n       interpretation is to abstract from textual variations of the same set,\\n       but we are free to interpret Metamath's formalism differently, and in\\n       fact let ` x ` run through all textual representations of sets.\\n\\n       Had we allowed ` ph ` to depend also on ` y ` , this idea is both harder\\n       to see, and it is less clear that this extra freedom introduces effects\\n       not covered by other axioms.
