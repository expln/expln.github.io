Definition 1 (axioms FI, FIIa, FIIb, FIII)\\n       of [BourbakiTop1] p.  I.36.  Filters are used to define the concept of\\n       limit in the general case.  They are a generalization of the idea of\\n       neighborhoods.  Suppose you are in ` RR ` .  With neighborhoods you can\\n       express the idea of a variable that tends to a specific number but you\\n       can't express the idea of a variable that tends to infinity.  Filters\\n       relax the \\\"axioms\\\" of neighborhoods and then succeed in expressing the\\n       idea of something that tends to infinity.  Filters were invented by\\n       Cartan in 1937 and made famous by Bourbaki in his treatise.  A notion\\n       similar to the notion of filter is the concept of net invented by Moore\\n       and Smith in 1922.  (Contributed by FL, 20-Jul-2007.)
