Based on definition\\n       of bra in [Prugovecki] p. 186 (p. 180 in 1971 edition).  In Dirac\\n       bra-ket notation, ` <. A | B >. ` is a complex number equal to the inner\\n       product ` ( B .ih A ) ` .  But physicists like to talk about the\\n       individual components ` <. A | ` and ` | B >. ` , called bra and ket\\n       respectively.  In order for their properties to make sense formally, we\\n       define the ket ` | B >. ` as the vector ` B ` itself, and the bra\\n       ` <. A | ` as a functional from ` ~H ` to ` CC ` .  We represent the\\n       Dirac notation ` <. A | B >. ` by ` ( ( bra `` A ) `` B ) ` ; see\\n       ~ braval .  The reversal of the inner product arguments not only makes\\n       the bra-ket behavior consistent with physics literature (see comments\\n       under ~ ax-his3 ) but is also required in order for the associative law\\n       ~ kbass2 to work.\\n\\n       Our definition of bra and the associated outer product ~ df-kb differs\\n       from, but is equivalent to, a common approach in the literature that\\n       makes use of mappings to a dual space.  Our approach eliminates the need\\n       to have a parallel development of this dual space and instead keeps\\n       everything in Hilbert space.\\n\\n       _For an extensive discussion about how our notation maps to the bra-ket\\n       notation in physics textbooks, see ~ mmnotes.txt , under the 17-May-2006\\n       entry_.
