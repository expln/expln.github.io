In classical logic\\n     (which is our logic), a wff is interpreted as either true or false.  So if\\n     ` ph ` is true, then ` -. ph ` is false; if ` ph ` is false, then\\n     ` -. ph ` is true.  Traditionally, Greek letters are used to represent\\n     wffs, and we follow this convention.  In propositional calculus, we define\\n     only wffs built up from other wffs, i.e. there is no starting or \\\"atomic\\\"\\n     wff.  Later, in predicate calculus, we will extend the basic wff\\n     definition by including atomic wffs ( ~ weq and ~ wel ).\",\"v\":\"$#\",\"pa\":\"\",\"r\":\"#%$\"}")
