In probability theory, the\\n       notation ` P ( X = A ) ` denotes the probability that a random variable\\n       ` X ` takes the value ` A ` .  We introduce here an operator which\\n       enables to write this in Metamath as ` ( P `` ( X oRVC _I A ) ) ` , and\\n       keep a similar notation.  Because with this notation ` ( X oRVC _I A ) `\\n       is a set, we can also apply it to conditional probabilities, like in\\n       ` ( P `` ( X oRVC _I A ) | ( Y oRVC _I B ) ) ) ` .\\n\\n       The oRVC operator transforms a relation ` R ` into an operation taking a\\n       random variable ` X ` and a constant ` C ` , and returning the preimage\\n       through ` X ` of the equivalence class of ` C ` .\\n\\n       The most commonly used relations are: - equality: ` { X = A } ` as\\n       ` ( X oRVC _I A ) ` cf. ~ ideq - elementhood: ` { X e. A } ` as\\n       ` ( X oRVC _E A ) ` cf. ~ epel - less-than: ` { X <_ A } ` as\\n       ` ( X oRVC <_ A ) `\\n\\n       Even though it is primarily designed to be used within probability\\n       theory and with random variables, this operator is defined on generic\\n       functions, and could be used in other fields, e.g. for continuous\\n       functions.
